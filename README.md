## üöÄ Project Overview
Resource Scheduler helps teams manage allocations, projects, time off, and more, with a beautiful and intuitive UI. **Now with real backend persistence using SQLite database!**

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Getting Started

### 1. Start the Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```
- The backend will run at: **http://127.0.0.1:3001**
- SQLite database will be created automatically at: `backend/resource_scheduler.db`

### 2. Start the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
- The frontend will run at: **http://localhost:8080** (or as shown in your terminal)

---

## üåê Accessing the App
- **Frontend:** [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- **Backend API:** [http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/hello](http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/hello)

---

## üß™ Testing the API

To verify that the backend-frontend communication is working correctly:

```bash
# From the project root
node test-api.js
```

This will run a comprehensive test suite that:
- Tests all API endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Verifies data persistence
- Checks error handling
- Validates data integrity

---

## üß© Main Features

- **Resource Dashboard:** Overview of team allocation, project distribution, and capacity.
- **Team Management:** Add, edit, and remove team members with real backend persistence.
- **Project Management:** Create and manage projects with timelines and allocations.
- **Calendar View:** Visualize allocations and filter by project or team member.
- **Time Off Management:** Manage holidays and vacations with server-side storage.
- **Settings:** Configure buffer time and weekly hours per country with API persistence.
- **Data Export/Import:** Export all data to Excel and import from Excel files.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Backend (Node.js + Express + SQLite)
- **Database:** SQLite with automatic table creation
- **API Endpoints:** RESTful API for all resources
- **Data Validation:** Server-side validation and error handling
- **CORS:** Enabled for frontend communication

### Frontend (React + TypeScript + Vite)
- **API Integration:** Full API communication via fetch
- **State Management:** React hooks with API synchronization
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- **Loading States:** Proper loading indicators for all API operations

### Data Flow
1. **Frontend** makes API calls to **Backend**
2. **Backend** validates and stores data in **SQLite database**
3. **Backend** returns response to **Frontend**
4. **Frontend** updates UI and shows success/error messages

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
- **Backend not starting:** Check if port 3001 is available, or change the port in `backend/index.js`
- **Database issues:** Delete `backend/resource_scheduler.db` to reset the database
- **API connection errors:** Ensure the backend is running before starting the frontend
- **CORS errors:** Check that the backend CORS settings match your frontend URL
- **Data not persisting:** Verify that the backend is running and accessible
- For any issues, check the browser console and terminal output.
- Make sure Node.js and npm are properly installed and in your PATH.
